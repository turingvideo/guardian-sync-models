# Turing Template

Template repository for Python, including **PR template**, **issue template**, **branch protection settings** and recommended practices.

## Recommended Practices

Per the requirement of SOC2 compliance, when you create a new repo, you need:

1. Add a pull request template to your repo. You can either use this template when you create repo OR copy `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to your repo and customize it.
2. Protect your default branch (`Require pull request reviews before merging` is required).
3. Add a descirption for your repo
4. (Recommended) Add a codeowner to your repo. You can either use this template when you create repo OR copy `.github/CODEOWNER` to your repo and customize it.
